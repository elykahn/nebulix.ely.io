  ely.io is the work, art and personal creations of ely kahn. If you're not a
  tech-savvy geek(1st, good going, stay strong) you might noty know I/O is
  Input/Output, though technically in domains it's the British Indian
  Ocean…Anyway, I like thinking about the inputs, senses and experiences goping
  into my bodu and mind and the output, creative(and otherwise) expressions of
  all that mess spun together and making connections I've yet to know.
